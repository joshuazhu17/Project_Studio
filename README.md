# Hex Reinforcement Learning Bot: Project Studio

Over the course of the school year, I developed two reinforcement learning agents for the board game Hex as well as the environment for the game. Using only Pytorchâ€™s most basic linear layers, I implemented the policy gradient algorithm and the monte carlo tree search algorithm. I also built the environment and game controller entirely from scratch in Python.

Contained in this repository are Google Colab notebooks containing the code that I wrote.
